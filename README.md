## Background
This game was created to be used as a reference for anyone interested in making their own DS homebrew games with NightFox's Lib. I tried to make the code as clean and well-structured as possible, but feel free to ask any questions if you need anything to be clarified. It's also a somewhat fun game on it's own with all the features you'd expect from a Snake clone, so you can grab a build [here](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Snake-DS/releases/) if you want to try it out :)

## Usage

NightFox's Lib does not need to be downloaded as it is already integrated into this repository, but to compile this code you'll need to install the libnds libraries with [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started). Then, after downloading and extracting the files in this repository, run the ``compile.bat`` script to compile the code.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Feel free to create a fork of this repository or use the code for any other noncommercial purposes.
